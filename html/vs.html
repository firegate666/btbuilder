<p>Some implementation of the Bard's Tale Construction Set functionality in
Bt Builder is not exactly the same as the original.  Most changes have been
made to conform with the earlier Bard's Tale games.<p>

<p><h2>Character Creation</h2></p>

<p>The BTCS does not list the starting hit point range for characters.
Currently Bt Builder uses 15 to 28 plus 1 for each point of constitution
above 14.  If someone knows the correct range or creates a BTCS character
that is not in this range, please send me an
<a href="mailto:dulsi@identicalsoftware.com">email</a>.</p>

<p>The first question is what gender you wish to be like BT3 which is
followed by race selection. After select a race in BTCS, ability scores are
determined and shown until a key is pressed. It then lists the available
classes with the abilities possibly scrolling offscreen. The previous Bard's
Tale games would list the ability scores and available classes on a single
screen. Bt Builder uses the older display.</p>

<p><h2>Adventurer's Guild</h2></p>

<p>When listing characters to add a member to the party or delete, BTCS
displays a list of nine characters and "(More)" if there are more
characters.  The older games displayed scrolling a list of characters
allowing the player to scroll up and down.  Bt Builder has decided to
conform to the older games.  Unfortunately BTCS also puts the saved
parties at the end of the roster which requires scrolling through the
entire list.  Bt Builder displays parties at the top of the roster.</p>

<p><h2>Garth's</h2></p>

<p>BTCS displays a list of items available with numbers one to nine.  After
you select an item by pressing it's number, it displays the price and allow
you to accept or decline.  The older Bard's Tale games displayed the list
of item with price.  Since they allowed more than nine items in the shop
they allow you to scroll up and down the list to select one.  Bt Builder
mimics the older Bard's Tale games.  Similar change has been made to the
selling interface.</p>

<p>By default the shop has the first nine items in it in unlimited
numbers. This can be customized for games built with Bt Builder. The shop
does keep anything sold to it just like the older Bard's Tale games.</p>

<p><h2>Combat</h2></p>

<p>BTCS does not allow you to choose what monsters to attack with melee
attack.  Instead it is randomly determined based on what monsters are
within range.  Previous Bard's Tales allowed you to choose who to attack.
Our implementation is like the older games with the exception that it
will randomly find an opponent if the group you specified has been killed.</p>

<p>Hiding in shadows works like it does in BT3. Every time you succeed you
can attack opponents 10' further than the last time. If you attack, you have
a chance to critically hit.</p>

<p><h2>Using Items</h2></p>

<p>BTCS allows you to only use equipped items. To deal with running out of
ammo, you can go to the character status screeens in a combat and equip new
items if needed. Effectively this means you can use an item with only the
minor hinderance that you may have to temporary unequip some item for a round.
Some previous Bard's Tale games have allowed you to use uneqipped items while
others do not. At the moment Bt Builder currently requires items to be
equipped except for arrows and thrown weapons. This may be extended to
miscellaneous item.</p>

<p>In BTCS you use a bow and the equipped arrows are automatically decremented
and damage calculated. Bt Builder has you select the arrows you want to use
instead of using the bow. Arrows are not required to be equipped to prevent
the need to go to the status screen during combat.</p>

<p><h2>Icons</h2></p>

<p>Icons have been added to main screen.  They are not currently animated.
The light spell spell creates a flame.  Trap destruction creates an eye.
The compass spell shows the direction your party is facing.</p>
